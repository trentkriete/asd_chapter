	abstract={Over the last 2 centuries, the predominant view of the cerebellum has  been that it is part of a motor control system. Evidence is now  presented that the neocerebellum, the evolutionarily newest region of  the cerebellum, may also be involved in a key mental operation: the  voluntary shift of selective attention between sensory modalities. It  is theorized that this newly recognized function may operate via  previously described sensory modulation properties of the cerebellum  and its many connections with areas known to be important for selective  attention, such as the pulvinar, the superior colliculus, and the  parietal and frontal cortices.}

Striatal male D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 receptor density increases 144+/-26% between 25 and 40days (the onset of puberty), while female D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4  receptor density increases only 31+/-7%.

	journal={Neurology},
	volume={59},
	number={2},
	pages={175-183},
	abstract={Objective: To determine whether brain volume, as assessed on MRI scans, differs between individuals with autism and control subjects, and whether such differences are affected by age. Background: Previous studies have found increased brain weight, head circumference, and MRI brain volume in children with autism. However, studies of brain size in adults with autism have yielded conflicting results. The authors hypothesize that enlargement of the brain may be a feature of brain development during early childhood in autism that normalizes with maturational processes. Methods: The authors measured total brain volumes from 1.5-mm coronal MRI scans in 67 non-mentally retarded children and adults with autism and 83 healthy community volunteers, ranging in age from 8 to 46 years. Head circumference was also measured. Groups did not differ on age, sex, verbal IQ, or socioeconomic status. Results: Brain volumes were significantly larger for children with autism 12 years old and younger compared with normally developing children, when controlling for height. Brain volumes for individuals older than age 12 did not differ between the autism and control groups. Head circumference was increased in both younger and older groups of subjects with autism, suggesting that those subjects older than age 12 had increased brain volumes as children. Conclusions: Brain development in autism follows an abnormal pattern, with accelerated growth in early life that results in brain enlargement in childhood. Brain volume in adolescents and adults with autism is, however, normal, and appears to be due to a slight decrease in brain volume for these individuals at the same time that normal children are experiencing a slight increase.}

	pages={347-350(4)},
	abstract={"
It has recently been shown that the lobules 9 and 10 of the cerebellum contain high densities of dopamine D3 receptors (and almost no D2 receptors [Bouthenet, M.L., Souil, E., Martres, M.P., Sokoloff, P., Giros, B. and Schwartz, J.C., Brain Res., 564 (1991) 203-219; Sokoloff, P., Giros, B., Martres, M.P., Bouthenet, M.L. and Schwartz, J.C., Nature, 347 (1990) 146-151]), and the functional role of this cerebellar dopamine system is unknown. In this study, using microinjections of dopamine receptor ligands into the lobules 9 and 10 of the cerebellum and into the nucleus accumbens, we show that the cerebellar dopamine D3 receptors have a functional role in the regulation of locomotor activity. When microinjected into the lobules 9 and 10 of the cerebellum, amisulpride (a dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist) and nafadotride (a preferential D3 antagonist) dose-dependently alter locomotor activity. At low doses, both agents stimulate locomotor activity, while inhibition is observed at higher doses. Haloperidol (a D2 antagonist) and apomorphine (a dopamine agonist) have no effects at low doses, but decrease locomotor activity at high doses. Similar effects are found in the nucleus accumbens, however the effects are stronger in the nucleus accumbens than in the cerebellum. Therefore, the dopamine D3 receptor system in lobules 9 and 10 of the cerebellum has a functional role, similar but weaker than the D3 receptor system in the nucleus accumbens."},

	volume={22},
	number={2},
	pages={546-553},
	abstract={A number of functional hypotheses have recently been advanced to account for how the cerebellum may contribute to cognition. Neuropsychological studies suggest the cerebellum is involved in switching attentional set. We present evidence that fails to support this hypothesis. Rather, we propose that in such tasks, the cerebellum is involved with the remapping of response alternatives to different types of stimuli. In our experiment, participants fixated on the center of a screen onto which a random presentation of four visual stimuli was presented. The stimuli were grouped along two dimensions (color: red square or blue square; shape: white circle or white triangle). Participants were instructed to respond with a button press only to presented stimuli for a particular dimension (e.g., red squares), to switch between two dimensions (where the target on the attended dimension served both as a signal for a response and as an indicator to shift attention to the other dimension), or to switch attention between two dimensions but make an overt response only to targets on one of the dimensions. Using functional imaging, we identify areas of lateral cerebellar cortex that are recruited when subjects must reassign motor responses to different stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate that switching of attention between dimensions without a motor response does not produce stronger activation within the cerebellum compared with conditions involving response and attention to a single dimension. These results suggest the cerebellum is involved in response reassignment.}

In this study the object play of 27 young children with autism was measured in a semi-structured context to quantify restricted object use. It was hypothesized that children who engaged in less restricted object use would show better responding, joint attention, motor imitation, and intentional communication. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between restricted object use measured at time 1 and response to joint attention, motor imitation, and coordinated attention to object and person, at time 1 and time 2 (6 months later), controlling for developmental play level. The construct validity of this measure of restricted object use was supported by the statistically significant correlations in the predicted direction of all expected associations.}

Based on 1) neuroanatomical and neuroimaging studies indicating aberrations in brain regions that are rich in glutamate neurons and 2) similarities between symptoms produced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists in healthy subjects and those seen in autism, it is proposed in the present paper that infantile autism is a hypoglutamatergic disorder. Possible future pharmacological interventions in autism are discussed in the light of the intimate interplay between central glutamate and serotonin, notably the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor. The possible benefit of treatment with glutamate agonists [e.g. agents acting on the modulatory glycine site of the NMDA receptor, or so-called ampakines acting on the &#33-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor] is discussed, as well as the potential usefulness of a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.},

An argument is made that cortical malformation  leads to abnormalities of thalamocortical connectivity, and that  serotonin plays a critical role in this process.

Anatomical and pharmacological evidence suggests that the dorsal raphe serotonin system and the ventral tegmental and substantia nigra dopamine system may act as mutual opponents. In the light of the temporal difference model of the involvement of the dopamine system in reward learning, we consider three aspects of motivational opponency involving dopamine and serotonin. We suggest that a tonic serotonergic signal reports the long-run average reward rate as part of an average-case reinforcement learning model; that a tonic dopaminergic signal reports the long-run average punishment rate in a similar context; and finally speculate that a phasic serotonin signal might report an ongoing prediction error for future punishment."},

A criterion for inclusion in the study was a relatively low  level of R-BH4 in the cerebrospinal fluid. For clinical evaluation, the  Parental Satisfaction Survey (PASS) was used every fourth week and the  Griffiths Developmental Scales were used before starting and 3 months  after completing the treatment. During the treatment period, all  parents reported improvements in the child's social functioning-mainly  eye contact and desire to interact-and in the number of words or sounds  which the child used. Small positive changes were noted on the  Griffiths Developmental Scales between the two testing occasions. R-BH4  levels in CSF increased significantly after treatment. The positron  emission tomography (PET) study showed that the high value of dopamine  D2 receptor binding in the caudate and putamen decreased by about 10%  towards the normal level after treatment with R-BH4. The observations  in this open study indicate that the drug might be useful for a  subgroup of children with autism, but there is a need for a larger  double-blind study with a longer treatment period.},

	pages={51-72},
	abstract={Dopamine (DA) depletion in the basal ganglia (BG) of Parkinson's  patients gives rise to both frontal-like and implicit learning  impairments. Dopaminergic medication alleviates some cognitive deficits  but impairs those that depend on intact areas of the BG, apparently due  to DA ''overdose.'' These findings are difficult to accommodate with  verbal theories of BG/DA function, owing to complexity of system  dynamics: DA dynamically modulates function in the BG, which is itself  a modulatory system. This article presents a neural network model that  instantiates key biological properties and provides insight into the  underlying role of DA in the BG during learning and execution of  cognitive tasks. Specifically, the BG modulates the execution of  ''actions'' (e.g., motor different parts of the frontal cortex. Phasic  changes in DA, which occur during error feedback, dynamically modulate  the BG threshold for facilitating/suppressing a cortical command in  response to particular stimuli. Reduced dynamic range of DA explains  Parkinson and DA overdose deficits with a single underlying  dysfunction, despite overall differences in raw DA levels. Simulated  Parkinsonism and medication effects provide a theoretical basis for  behavioral data in probabilistic classification and reversal tasks. The  model also provides novel testable predictions for neuropsychological  and pharmacological studies, and motivates further investigation of  BG/DA interactions with the prefrontal cortex in working memory.}

	abstract={We recorded electrical activity from 532 neurons in the rostral part of inferior area 6 (area F5) of two macaque monkeys. Previous data had shown that neurons of this area discharge during goal-directed hand and mouth movements. We describe here the properties of a newly discovered set of F5 neurons ( mirror neurons', n = 92) all of which became active both when the monkey performed a given action and when it observed a similar action performed by the experimenter. Mirror neurons, in order to be visually triggered, required an interaction between the agent of the action and the object of it. The sight of the agent alone or of the object alone (three-dimensional objects, food) were ineffective. Hand and the mouth were by far the most effective agents. The actions most represented among those activating mirror neurons were grasping, manipulating and placing. In most mirror neurons (92%) there was a clear relation between the visual action they responded to and the motor response they coded. In [~]30% of mirror neurons the congruence was very strict and the effective observed and executed actions corresponded both in terms of general action (e.g. grasping) and in terms of the way in which that action was executed (e.g. precision grip). We conclude by proposing that mirror neurons form a system for matching observation and execution of motor actions. We discuss the possible role of this system in action recognition and, given the proposed homology between F5 and human Brocca's region, we posit that a matching system, similar to that of mirror neurons exists in humans and could be involved in recognition of actions as well as phonetic gestures.},

	abstract={What brain mechanisms underlie autism, and how do they give rise to  autistic behavioral symptoms? This article describes a neural model,  called the Imbalanced Spectrally Timed Adaptive Resonance Theory  (iSTART) model, that proposes how cognitive, emotional, timing, and  motor processes that involve brain regions such as the prefrontal and  temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum may interact to  create and perpetuate autistic symptoms. These model processes were  originally developed to explain data concerning how the brain controls  normal behaviors. The iSTART model shows how autistic behavioral  symptoms may arise from prescribed breakdowns in these brain processes,  notably a combination of underaroused emotional depression in the  amygdala and related affective brain regions, learning of hyperspecific  recognition categories in the temporal and prefrontal cortices, and  breakdowns of adaptively timed attentional and motor circuits in the  hippocampal system and cerebellum. The model clarifies how malfunctions  in a subset of these mechanisms can, through a systemwide vicious  circle of environmentally mediated feedback, cause and maintain  problems with them all.

	abstract={The autistic syndromes are caused by neurological dysfunctions. The  capacity of autistic individuals to form representations of previous  sensory impressions, useful for the processing of present information,  is impaired. Self-organizing feature maps are mathematical models of  cortical feature maps and may be used to simulate cortical processing.  Dysfunctional self-organization, resulting in disability to extract  features from stimuli, is proposed as a neural circuit theory of  autism. The nature and a possible cause of dysfunctional  self-organization are examined. It is shown that impaired feature  detection is valid for explaining the memory function in autism, the  lack of drive for central coherence according to Frith's theory of  autism, and a number of impairments from the diagnostic criteria.  Unequal levels of impairment of different cortical feature maps can  account for the typically uneven intelligence profile of autistic  individuals. Excessive inhibitory lateral feedback synaptic connection  strengths are presented as one factor impairing the development of  feature maps. Strong or excessive inhibitory lateral feedback synaptic  connection strengths also cause high sensory discrimination and  abnormal sensory responses, both documented in autism. A neural circuit  theory for autism has been presented. For a proof of this neural  circuit theory neurological investigations are required.},

We used an automated technique of analysis that accurately measures the thickness of the cerebral cortex and generates cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. We found local decreases of gray matter in the ASD group in areas belonging to the mirror neuron system (MNS), argued to be the basis of empathic behavior. Cortical thinning of the MNS was correlated with ASD symptom severity. Cortical thinning was also observed in areas involved in emotion recognition and social cognition. These findings suggest that the social and emotional deficits characteristic of autism may reflect abnormal thinning of the MNS and the broader network of cortical areas subserving social cognition.},

The present paper reports results from a first study of low-level visual integration in autism. Twenty-five subjects with autism, 21 normal 7- and 8-year-olds, and 26 children with learning difficulties were asked to make simple judgements about six well-known visual illusions. Two conditions were used, in an attempt to explore group differences; standard two-dimensional black and white line drawings, and the same figures augmented with raised coloured lines. The subjects with autism were less likely to succumb to the two-dimensional illusions than were the other groups, and were less aided by the three-dimensional disembedded' condition. These striking results are discussed with reference to the 'central coherence' account of autism.}

	abstract={We have taken a novel approach to the study of problem solving  involving the detailed analysis of natural scanning eye movements  during the 'one touch' Tower of London task. Control subjects and  patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PDs) viewed a series of  pictures depicting two arrangements of coloured balls in pockets within  the upper and lower halves of a computer display. The task was to plan  (but not execute) the shortest movement sequence required to rearrange  the balls in one half of the display (the Workspace) to match the  arrangement in the opposite half (the Goalspace) and indicate the  number of moves required for problem solution. As problem complexity  increased, control subjects spent proportionally more time fixating the  Workspace region. This pattern was found regardless of whether subjects  were instructed to solve problems by rearranging balls in the lower or  upper visual fields. The distribution of gaze within the Workspace was  also found to be problem dependent, with gaze being selectively  directed towards the problem critical balls. In contrast, PDs were  found to make more errors in the task and failed to show any  dissociation in the amount of time fixating the two halves of the  display. This pattern suggests that the patients had difficulty in  encoding and/or maintaining current goals during problem solving,  consistent with a role for fronto-striatal circuits in mechanisms of  working memory and attention.},

Two blinded researchers, with good inter-rater reliability, outlined the right and left caudate and putamen. Autistic and control BG volumes covaried for total brain volume were compared using analysis of covariance. BG volumes within the autistic group were correlated with the ADI Repetitive Behavior scores (ADI-C domain).Results Right caudate volume controlled for total brain volume was significantly larger in autistic subjects than in controls. In addition, right caudate and total putamen volumes correlated positively with repetitive behavior scores on the ADI-C domain, particularly the higher order OCD-like repetitive behaviors.Conclusions Increased right caudate volume in autism is of interest, since this has also been observed in OCD patients. Increased volume of the right caudate and total putamen positively correlated with greater repetitive behaviors, supporting the hypothesis of BG dysfunction associated with repetitive behaviors in autistic adults.},

The authors review evidence from animal studies demonstrating that the nonapeptides, oxytocin and vasopressin, have unique effects on the normal expression of species-typical social behavior, communication, and rituals. Based on this evidence, they hypothesize that an abnormality in oxytocin or vasopressin neurotransmission may account for several features of autism. As autism appears to be a genetic disorder, mutations in the various peptide, peptide receptor, or lineage-specific developmental genes could lead to altered oxytocin or vasopressin neurotransmission. Many of these genes have been cloned and sequenced, and several polymorphisms have been identified. Recent gene targeting studies that alter expression of either the peptides or their receptors in the rodent brain partially support the autism hypothesis. While previous experience suggests caution in hypothesizing a cause or suggesting a treatment for autism, the available preclinical evidence with oxytocin and vasopressin recommends the need for clinical studies using gene scanning, pharmacological and neurobiological approaches.},

	abstract={"
Although under some conditions the attention-related late positive event-related potential (ERP) response (LPC) is apparently normal in autism during visual processing, the LPC elicited by visuospatial processing may be compromised. Results from this study provide evidence for abnormalities in autism in two components of the LPC generated during spatial processing. The early frontal distribution of the LPC which may reflect attention orienting was delayed or missing in autistic subjects during conditions in which attention was to peripheral visual fields. The later parietal distribution of the LPC which may be associated with context updating was smaller in amplitude in autistic subjects regardless of attention location. Both abnormalities suggest disruption of function in spatial attention networks in autism. Evidence that the cerebellar abnormalities in autism may underlie these deficits comes from: (1) similar results in ERP responses and spatial attention deficits in patients with cerebellar lesions; (2) brain-behavior correlations in normally functioning individuals associating the size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and the latency of the frontal LPC; and (3) a previously reported complementary correlation between the size of the posterior vermal lobules and spatial orienting speed. Although the scalp-recorded LPC is thought to be cortically generated, it may be modulated by subcortical neural activity. The cerebellum may serve as a modulating influence by affecting the task-related antecedent attentional process. The electrophysiological abnormalities reported here index spatial attention deficits in autism that may reflect cerebellar influence on both frontal and parietal spatial attention function."},

Various deficits in the cognitive functioning of people with autism have been documented in recent years but these provide only partial explanations for the condition. We focus instead on an imitative disturbance involving difficulties both in copying actions and in inhibiting more stereotyped mimicking, such as echolalia. A candidate for the neural basis of this disturbance may be found in a recently discovered class of neurons in frontal cortex, 'mirror neurons' (MNs). These neurons show activity in relation both to specific actions performed by self and matching actions performed by others, providing a potential bridge between minds. MN systems exist in primates without imitative and 'theory of mind' abilities and we suggest that in order for them to have become utilized to perform social cognitive functions, sophisticated cortical neuronal systems have evolved in which MNs function as key elements. Early developmental failures of MN systems are likely to result in a consequent cascade of developmental impairments characterised by the clinical syndrome of autism."},

	pages={676-681},
	abstract={A dynamic interaction between the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) may be fundamental to regulation of goal-directed behavior by affective and cognitive processes. This study demonstrates that a mechanism for this triadic relationship is an inhibitory control by prefrontal cortex on accumbal dopamine release during amygdala activation. In freely moving rats, microstimulation of basolateral amygdala at intensities that produced mild behavioral activation produced an expected rapid increase in glutamate efflux in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens shell region of the ventral striatum. However, during the stimulation, dopamine release increased only in the prefrontal cortex, not in the nucleus accumbens. An increase in accumbal dopamine release was observed during the stimulation if glutamate activation in the prefrontal cortex was inhibited at either presynaptic or postsynaptic levels. Some behaviors expressed during the stimulation were intensified in animals in which prefrontal cortex glutamate activation was blocked. In addition, these animals continued to express stimulus-induced behaviors after the termination of stimulation, whereas normal poststimulus behaviors such as ambulation and grooming were not displayed as frequently. Considering that dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens is thought to play an integral role in goal-directed motor behavior, these findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex influences the behavioral impact of amygdala activation via a concomitant active suppression of accumbal dopamine release. Absence of this cortical influence appears to result in an aberrant pattern of behavioral expression in response to amygdala activation, including behavioral perseveration after stimulus termination.}

local over global processing, using a novel drawing task based on the classical

It was  hypothesized that these problems result from an underlying impairment  in category formation. Persons with autism may not abstract a summary  representation (a prototype) during category learning and, instead, may  form categories by memorizing a list of rules. Children with autism,  Down syndrome, and normal development participated in one set of  category learning tasks that could be solved using a rule-based  approach and a second set of tasks in which there was no rule that  defined category membership (prototype tasks). In the rule-based tasks,  all groups were successful at using a rule to learn a new category. In  the prototype tasks, only the typically developing children were able  to learn a new category. Neither the persons with autism nor the  persons with Down syndrome appeared to develop a prototype during  category learning. These data suggest that persons with autism and Down  syndrome have difficulty categorizing new information by forming  prototypes and, instead, tend to rely on a rule-based approach to  learning.}

	abstract={Cocaine abuse is a significant problem in the United States, including its use by approximately 1% of pregnant women. Cocaine acts as an indirect agonist of dopamine at the dopamine transporter, resulting in the presence of excess dopamine in the synapse. Since synaptic dopamine can rapidly oxidize to form free radicals, it was hypothesized that exposure to this drug might produce damage in dopaminergic systems such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, damage to which is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. To test this hypothesis we exposed mice both in utero and as adults to cocaine and examined its effects on the nigrostriatal system. We found that exposure to cocaine both in utero or as adults did not affect substantia nigra cell number, but did make these neurons more susceptible to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. We also found long-lasting changes in D2 receptor mRNA levels as well as changes in the monoamine transport system and several growth factors. This work suggests that use of cocaine might be a predisposing factor for development of Parkinson’s disease in both adults exposed chronically as well as in individuals exposed prenatally.},

Each theory is evaluated critically with regard to the primary neuropsychological deficit hypothesized and the research findings that have been offered in support of it.

J. Neurophysiol. 82: 978-998, 1999. Neurons in the primate striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta change their firing patterns during sensory-motor learning. To study the consequences of nigrostriatal dopamine depletion for learning and memory of motor sequences, we used a neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), to deplete dopamine unilaterally in the striatum of macaque monkeys either before or after training them on sequential push-button motor tasks. We compared the monkeys' performance with the arms ipsilateral and contralateral to dopamine depletion. During training and retraining on the tasks, we measured initial and serial movement times and reaction times for the push button movements, electromyographic patterns of arm and orofacial muscle activity during button pushing and reward licking, and saccadic eye movements during the button push sequences. With the arm ipsilateral to the side of dopamine depletion, each monkey showed progressive shortening of movement times and initial and serial reaction times, and each developed consistent strategies of hand-orofacial and hand-eye coordination in which single button push movements were linked efficiently to succeeding movements so that performance of the whole sequence became predictive. These patterns did not develop for contralateral arm performance in this monkey treated with MPTP before training. With the arm contralateral to dopamine depletion, the monkey showed significant quantitative deficits in all parameters measured except initial reaction times. Movement times and serial reaction times were longer than those for the ipsilateral arm; anticipatory saccadic eye movements were not well time-locked to individual button pushes made with the contralateral hand; and push and licking movements were not smoothly coordinated. This monkey further showed striking differences in performance when using the ipsilateral and contralateral arms in switch trial tests in which reward was delivered unexpectedly one button early. He continued to make movements to the previously rewarded button with the ipsilateral arm but showed no such automatic movements when he used his contralateral arm. For the monkey treated with MPTP after training, performance on the push-button task was skilled for both arms before dopamine depletion, but the unilateral dopamine depletion produced deficits in contralateral arm performance for all parameters measured, again excepting initial reaction times. With retraining, however, his performance with the contralateral arm improved. We conclude that the striatum and its nigrostriatal afferents function in the initial learning underlying performance of sequences of movements as single motor programs. The nigrostriatal system also operates during the retrieval of these programs once learning is accomplished, but lesions of the nigrostriatal system spare the ability to relearn the previously acquired programs.},

	abstract={The indirect catecholamine agonist methylphenidate (Ritalin) is the drug treatment of choice in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), one of the most common behavioral disorders of childhood (DSM-IV), although symptoms may persist into adulthood. Methylphenidate can enhance cognitive performance in adults and children diagnosed with AD/HD (Kempton et al., 1999; Riordan et al., 1999) and also in normal human volunteers on tasks sensitive to frontal lobe damage, including aspects of spatial working memory (SWM) performance (Elliott et al., 1997). The present study investigated changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by methylphenidate during performance of a self-ordered SWM task to define the neuroanatomical loci of the beneficial effect of the drug. The results show that the methylphenidate-induced improvements in working memory performance occur with task-related reductions in rCBF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The beneficial effects of methylphenidate on working memory were greatest in the subjects with lower baseline working memory capacity. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration of a localization of a drug-induced improvement in SWM performance in humans and has relevance for understanding the treatment of AD/HD.}

	abstract={Children's understanding that people's beliefs may differ from reality is an important milestone in cognitive development. Yet the tasks usually used to assess this understanding rely on the comprehension of complex syntax. Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have language abilities that are below age expectations, but their nonlinguistic cognitive abilities — crucial to false belief understanding — are closer to age level. Four conditions of a standard false belief task were administered to 10 children with SLI, 10 children of the same age, and 9 younger children whose language comprehension ability was similar to the children with SLI. The four conditions varied as to their linguistic complexity. The SLI group performed similarly to same-age peers when linguistic complexity was low, but similarly to younger children when linguistic complexity was high. These findings provide evidence that linguistic competence serves as a limiting factor in false belief performance for children with SLI. Educational objectives: Readers will be able to (1) describe different hypotheses regarding the relationship between language and theory of mind development, (2) discuss how linguistic complexity impacts false belief performance for children with SLI, and (3) apply the language/theory of mind relationship when planning intervention.},

They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.

In the current experiment, we examined the utility of hierarchical models in characterising musical information processing in autistic individuals. Participants were 13 high-functioning individuals with autism and 13 individuals of normal intelligence matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and laterality, and without musical experience. The task consisted of same-different judgements of pairs of melodies. Differential local and global processing was assessed by manipulating the level, local or global, at which modifications occurred. No deficit was found in the two measures of global processing. In contrast, the clinical group performed better than the comparison group in the detection of change in nontransposed, contour-preserved melodies that tap local processing. These findings confirm the existence of a "local bias" in music perception in individuals with autism, but challenge the notion that it is accounted for by a deficit in global music processing. The present study suggests that enhanced processing of elementary physical properties of incoming stimuli, as found previously in the visual modality, may also exist in the auditory modality.}

	pages={793-809},
	abstract={
Background: The  fundamental social disturbance of autism is characterized, in part, by  problems in the acquisition of joint attention skills in the first  years of life, followed by impairments in the development of social  cognition, as assessed on theory of mind (ToM) measures. Recently,  studies have indicated that a system involving the dorsal  medial-frontal cortex (DMFC), and the anterior cingulate (AC), may  contribute to the development of the tendency to initiate joint  attention in infancy. Similarly, research has implicated the DMFC/AC  system in ToM performance in typical and atypical individuals. These  data suggest it may be useful to consider the functions associated with  this system in the developmental psychopathology of autism.
Method: A review of the studies of the connections between the DMFC/AC system, joint attention and ToM task performance.
Results  and conclusions: This review raises the hypothesis that the DMFC/AC may  be involved in the basic disturbance in social orienting in autism. The  DMFAC/AC may also play a role in the capacity to monitor proprioceptive  information concerning self-action and integrate this self-related  information with exteroceptive perceptual information about the  behavior of other people. A disturbance in these functions of the  DMFC/AC may contribute to the atypical development of  intersubjectivity, joint attention and social cognition that may impair  the lives of people with autism. Thus, impairment in the development of  this system may constitute a neural substrate for socio-cognitive  deficits in autism.}

	abstract={Children with a diagnosis of autism and normally developing children,  matched for age and general ability, were tested on a series of visual  search tasks in 2 separate experiments. The children with autism  performed better than the normally developing children on difficult  visual search tasks. This result occurred regardless of whether the  target was uniquely defined by a single feature or a conjunction of  features, as long as ceiling effects did not mask the difference.  Superior visual search performance in autism can be seen as analogous  to other reports of enhanced unique item detection in autism. Unique  item detection in autism is discussed in the light of mechanisms  proposed to be involved in normal visual search performance}

	pages={1058-1066},
	abstract={OBJECTIVE: Measures of cholinergic transmitter activity were investigated in patients with autism because of reported neuropathological abnormalities in cholinergic nuclei in the basal forebrain. METHOD: Levels of cholinergic enzyme and receptor activity were measured in the frontal and parietal cerebral cortex of deceased autistic adults, similarly aged normal adults without mental retardation, and nonautistic mentally retarded adults. The immunoreactivity levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor were measured in the basal forebrain. RESULTS: There were no differences between the autistic and comparison groups in choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholinesterase activity in the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain or in muscarinic M2 receptor or {alpha}-bungarotoxin binding within the cortex. Cortical M1 receptor binding was up to 30% lower than normal in the autistic subjects, and the difference reached significance in the parietal cortex. In both the parietal and frontal cortices, differences in nicotinic receptors assessed by [3H]epibatidine binding were significant and extensive (65%-73% lower in the autistic group than in the normal subjects); there were no differences in nicotine binding in the basal forebrain. Immunochemical analysis indicated lower levels of both the {alpha}4 and {beta}2 nicotinic receptor subunits in the parietal cortex. The M1 receptor abnormality was not evident in the nonautistic group with mental retardation, although the lower [3H]epibatidine binding was apparent. In the basal forebrain, the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the autistic group was three times as high as the level of the normal group. CONCLUSIONS: These neurochemical abnormalities implicate the cholinergic system in developmental disorders such as autism and suggest the potential for intervention based on cholinergic receptor modulation.},

Control adults were better able to discriminate familiar than novel stimuli-the perceptual learning effect. No perceptual learning effect was observed in adults with autism although they discriminated the novel stimuli significantly better than control adults. This enhanced discrimination learning about novel, but not familiar, stimuli in autism is discussed in relation to two current hypotheses of information processing in autism-weak central coherence and reduced attention-switching-and a new third hypothesis, which suggests that features held in common between stimuli are processed poorly and features unique to a stimulus are processed well in autism.}

In the other, the conjunctive search task, the target shared colour with one set and shape with another set of distracters. Although search was slower in the conjunctive task than the feature task in normally developing control children, children with autism showed no significant slowing in reaction time in the conjunctive task and were faster than control children in this task. This result is discussed in the light of theories of visual search which state that rate of search is determined by the degree of similarity between target and distracters.}

In one variation, the divided attention task, no information was given to children regarding the level at which a target would appear on any one trial. In the other, the selective attention task, children were instructed to attend to either the local or the global level. Typically developing children made most errors when the target appeared at the local level whereas children with autism made more errors when the target appeared at the global level in the divided attention task. Both groups of children were quicker to respond to the global target than the local target in the selective attention task. The presence of normal global processing in the children with autism in one task but not in the other is discussed in terms of a deficit in mechanisms that inhibit local information in the absence of overt priming or voluntary selective attention to local information.}

During training, responding to one stimulus (S+) resulted in rewards whereas responding to the alternative (S−) was extinguished. Test 1 was conducted with recombinations of S+ and S− elements. In Test 2, the test stimulus to which the child responded most in Test 1 was pitched against the training S+. In Test 1, all children responded exclusively to one test probe, spuriously implying stimulus overselectivity in both populations. However, in Test 2, the typical children responded mostly to the training S+ indicating control by both S+ elements; the autistic children responded to both stimuli indicating reduced control by the second S+ element (indicating overselectivity).}

There is an increased but variable risk of epilepsy in autism. Three main factors-age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder-account for variability in the reported prevalence of epilepsy. The prevalence is highest in studies that have included adolescents and young adults, individuals with moderate to severe mental retardation and those with motor deficits, and individuals with severe receptive language deficits. The association of autism with clinical or subclinical epilepsy might denote common genetic factors in some cases. Whether subclinical epilepsy has adverse effects on cognition, language, and behaviour is debated, as is the relation of autistic regression with an epileptiform electroencephalogram to Landau-Kleffner syndrome. There is no evidence-based treatment recommendation for individuals with autism, regression, and subclinical epilepsy. Double-blind studies with sufficient power to resolve this issue are urgently needed."},

	abstract={Background: Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockdown (KD) mice, with  approximately 90% loss of expression of the DAT, allow for the  examination of the behavioral consequences of a chronically  dysregulated dopamine system. The DAT KD mice have hyperdopaminergic  tone, are hyperactive, and show impaired response inhibition in a  number of paradigms. We hypothesized that the DAT KD mice would also  display deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and would be  perseverative in their locomotor behavior. Methods: Basal levels of PPI  and patterns of locomotor behavior were measured in two cohorts of DAT  KD mice. In addition, measurements of locomotor behavior were recorded  after pretreatment with 100 mg/kg valproate in both DAT KD and wildtype  mice. Results: The DAT KD mice were hyperactive and displayed  perseverative motor behavior but had normal levels of PPI. The  clinically effective antimania drug valproate significantly attenuated  the hyperactivity and perseverative locomotor behavior in the DAT KD  mice and had no effect in control mice. Conclusions: The DAT KD mice  appear to provide a model of some aspects of manic behavior. With  limited models of bipolar disorder, the DAT KD mice might provide a  vehicle to screen for new psychiatric therapies to treat mania and its  related symptoms.},

	pages={285-297},
	abstract={The basal ganglia and cerebellum have traditionally been associated with motor performance. Recently, there has been considerable interest regarding the contributions of these subcortical structures to aspects of cognition. In particular, both the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been hypothesized to be involved in the control of attentional set. To date, no neuropsychological studies have directly compared the effects of basal ganglia and cerebellar dysfunction on the same attention shifting tasks. To this end, we employed an alternating attention task that has been used to demonstrate putative attentional control deficits in children with cerebellar pathology, either related to autism or neurological insult. When adult patients with either Parkinson's disease or cerebellar lesions were tested on this task, a similar pattern of deficits was observed for both groups. However, when the motor demands were reduced, cerebellar patients showed a significant improvement on the alternating attention task, whereas the Parkinson patients continued to exhibit an impairment. This dissociation suggests that attentional deficits reported previously as being due to cerebellar dysfunction may be, at least in part, secondary to problems related to coordinating successive responses. In contrast, attention-shifting deficits associated with basal ganglia impairment cannot be explained by recourse to the motor demands of the task.}

	abstract={Autistic and normal children were trained to respond to a complex stimulus containing two auditory components. After the discrimination was acquired, the individual components were presented separately, allowing assessment of the extent to which the child's responding was controlled by one or both of the cues. The autistic children, unlike the normal children, provided evidence for stimulus overselectivity in that 6 of 8 autistic subjects responded to only one of the components. These results are consistent with those of previous studies which showed that when autistic children are presented with a complex visual or multiple-modality stimulus, they selectively respond to only one component of the complex. The present results extend the stimulus overselectivity hypothesis to the situation where all of the stimuli occur within the auditory modality. It is suggested that auditory overselectivity may partially account for autistic deficits in speech comprehension.}

Despite recent advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

Failure on this task is frequently taken to diagnose the lack of a "theory of mind". We report two studies using two tasks that make similar executive demands to the false belief task. The first experiment showed that children with autism are significantly challenged by a "conflicting desire " task, which suggests that their difficulty with the false belief task is not rooted in difficulty with grasping the representational nature of belief. In the second study children with autism were also found to be impaired on a novel version of the " false photograph task". A parsimonious reading of these data is that their difficulty with all three tasks is due to commonalities in the tasks' executive structure.}

	abstract={As children with autism have pervasive executive difficulties it is necessary to determine whether these contribute to their often-reported failure on the false belief task. Failure on this task is frequently taken to diagnose the lack of a "theory of mind". We report two studies using two tasks that make similar executive demands to the false belief task. The first experiment showed that children with autism are significantly challenged by a "conflicting desire " task, which suggests that their difficulty with the false belief task is not rooted in difficulty with grasping the representational nature of belief. In the second study children with autism were also found to be impaired on a novel version of the " false photograph task". A parsimonious reading of these data is that their difficulty with all three tasks is due to commonalities in the tasks' executive structure.}

	abstract={"
Brothers (Brothers L. Concepts in Neuroscience 1990;1:27-51) proposed a network of neural regions that comprise the ''social brain'', which includes the amygdala. Since the childhood psychiatric condition of autism involves deficits in ''social intelligence'', it is plausible that autism may be caused by an amygdala abnormality. In this paper we review the evidence for a social function of the amygdala. This includes reference to the Kluver-Bucy syndrome (which Hetzler and Griffin suggested may serve as an animal model of autism). We then review evidence for an amygdala deficit in people with autism, who are well known to have deficits in social behaviour. This includes a detailed summary of our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving judging from the expressions of another person's eyes what that other person might be thinking or feeling. In this study, patients with autism or AS did not activate the amygdala when making mentalistic inferences from the eyes, whilst people without autism did show amygdala activity. The amygdala is therefore proposed to be one of several neural regions that are abnormal in autism. We conclude that the amygdala theory of autism contains promise and suggest some new lines of research."},

	abstract={It has been repeatedly reported that when presented with a discrimination task involving multiple cues, autistic children, as compared to normal children, tend to respond on the basis of only a restricted portion of the component cues. This phenomenon has been called â€œstimulus overselectivity â€ and has been implicated as a possible basis for some of the pronounced behavioral deficits characteristic of autism. Examination of the results of several previous studies suggests that the overselectivity effect might be reduced with repeated exposure to testing. However, since the previous studies were not designed to test this hypothesis, no conclusions were drawn regarding variables influencing the reduction of the overselectivity phenomenon. The present investigation was therefore conducted to determine if stimulus overselectivity in autistic children is changed as a function of repeated exposure to testing. Nineteen autistic children were trained on a discrimination task with a cue complex composed of two visual cues. After the children reached criterion on the task, they were exposed to a testing phase with probe trials where the cue components were presented singly. The results indicated that 16 of the children initially showed overselectivity and 3 responded to both cues. Of the 16 children who showed overselectivity, 13 decreased their level of overselectivity with continued testing. These results are discussed in relation to variables in the testing procedure itself and to the literature on selective attention.},

The autistic children were significantly more competent at this task than either

Since the performance of the autistic children was better than predicted from MA

is discussed in terms of orientation and visualization factors involved in
visuo-spatial abilities and is also related to cognitive deficit.

Only segmentation, but neither of the spatial orientation factors, revealed a significant group difference. Autistic subjects, regardless of age and ability, performed better than controls when presented with un segmented designs. This result suggests that they need less of the normally required effort to segment a gestalt, and thus supports the hypothesis of weak central coherence as a characteristic of information processing in autism.}

	abstract={The clinical benefits of dopamine agonists in the management of  epilepsy can be traced back over a century, whilst the introduction of  neuroleptics into psychiatry practice 40 years ago witnessed the  emergence of fits as a side effect of dopamine receptor blockade.  Epidemiologists noticed a reciprocal relationship between the supposed  dopaminergic overactivity syndrome of schizophrenia and epilepsy, which  came to be regarded as a dopamine underactivity condition. Early  pharmacological studies of epilepsy employed nonselective drugs, that  often did not permit dopamine's antiepileptic action to be clearly  dissociated from that of other monoamines. Likewise, the biochemical  search for genetic abnormalities in brain dopamine function, as  predeterminants of spontaneous epilepsy, proved largely inconclusive.  The discovery of multiple dopamine receptor families (D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT411RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 and D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4),  mediating opposing influences on neuronal excitability, heralded a new  era of dopamine-epilepsy research. The traditional anticonvulsant  action of dopamine was attributed to D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 receptor stimulation in the forebrain, while the advent of selective D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT411RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4  agonists with proconvulsant properties revealed for the first time that  dopamine could also lower the seizure threshold from the midbrain.  Whilst there is no immediate prospect of developing D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 agonists or D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT411RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4  antagonists as clinically useful antiepileptics, there is a growing  awareness that seizures might be precipitated as a consequence of  treating other neurological disorders with D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 antagonists (schizophrenia) or D0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT411RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 agonists (parkinsonism).},

Autism itself is frequently associated with the presence of learning disability and a variety of other medical conditions. These often coexisting factors are themselves associated with sleep abnormalities and therefore caution is needed when attempting to assess the relationship between autism and sleep abnormalities. Detailed consideration of the various possible causes of sleep problems is required to reach meaningful diagnostic and treatment decisions. The present account reviews the published work on sleep disturbance and autism, highlighting theoretical and practical issues which need further attention. Methods of assessing and treating sleep disorders are also discussed, with special consideration of factors related to autism which may affect the choice of method.}

	abstract={In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by neuropsychological and emotional deficits, including a blunted emotional response. In the present study, we explored both the neural basis of abnormal emotional behavior in PD and the physiological effects of dopaminergic therapy on the response of the amygdala, a central structure in emotion processing. PD patients and matched normal controls (NCs) were studied with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a paradigm that involved perceptual processing of fearful stimuli. PD patients were studied twice, once during a relatively hypodopaminergic state (i.e., [>=]12 hr after their last dose of dopamimetic treatment) and again during a dopamine-replete state. The imaging data revealed a robust bilateral amygdala response in NCs that was absent in PD patients during the hypodopaminergic state. Dopamine repletion partially restored this response in PD patients. Our results demonstrate an abnormal amygdala response in PD that may underlie the emotional deficits accompanying the disease. Furthermore, consistent with findings in experimental animal paradigms, our results provide in vivo evidence of the role of dopamine in modulating the response of the amygdala to sensory information in human subjects.}

	abstract={We propose a computational model of the emergence of gaze following skills in infant–caregiver interactions. The model is
based on the idea that infants learn that monitoring their caregiver’s direction of gaze allows them to predict the locations of
interesting objects or events in their environment (Moore \& Corkum, 1994). Elaborating on this theory, we demonstrate that
a specific Basic Set of structures and mechanisms is sufficient for gaze following to emerge. This Basic Set includes the infant’s
perceptual skills and preferences, habituation and reward-driven learning, and a structured social environment featuring a
caregiver who tends to look at things the infant will find interesting. We review evidence that all elements of the Basic Set are
established well before the relevant gaze following skills emerge. We evaluate the model in a series of simulations and show that
it can account for typical development. We also demonstrate that plausible alterations of model parameters, motivated by findings
on two different developmental disorders – autism and Williams syndrome – produce delays or deficits in the emergence of gaze
following. The model makes a number of testable predictions. In addition, it opens a new perspective for theorizing about
cross-species differences in gaze following.},

	abstract={Gaze following is the ability to redirect one's gaze to the location where another agent is looking. We present a computational model of how human infants or other agents may acquire gaze following by learning to predict the locations of interesting sights from the looking behavior of other agents through reinforcement learning. The model accounts for many findings about the development of gaze following in human infants. During learning, the model develops pre-motor representations that exhibit many properties characteristic of mirror neurons, but they are specific to looking behaviors. The existence of such a new class of mirror neurons is the main prediction of our model. The model also offers a parsimonious account of how these and possibly other mirror neurons may acquire their special response properties. In this account, visual representations of other agents' actions become associated with pre-motor neurons that represent the intention to perform corresponding actions. The model also demonstrates how this development may be obstructed in autism spectrum disorder, giving rise to specific physiological and anatomical differences in the mirror system.},

	abstract={"
A new class of visuomotor neuron has been recently discovered in the monkey's premotor cortex: mirror neurons. These neurons respond both when a particular action is performed by the recorded monkey and when the same action, performed by another individual, is observed. Mirror neurons appear to form a cortical system matching observation and execution of goal-related motor actions. Experimental evidence suggests that a similar matching system also exists in humans. What might be the functional role of this matching system? One possible function is to enable an organism to detect certain mental states of observed conspecifics. This function might be part of, or a precursor to, a more general mind-reading ability. Two different accounts of mind-reading have been suggested. According to `theory theory', mental states are represented as inferred posits of a naive theory. According to `simulation theory', other people's mental states are represented by adopting their perspective: by tracking or matching their states with resonant states of one's own. The activity of mirror neurons, and the fact that observers undergo motor facilitation in the same muscular groups as those utilized by target agents, are findings that accord well with simulation theory but would not be predicted by theory theory."},
