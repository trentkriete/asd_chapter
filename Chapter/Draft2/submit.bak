\abstract{
The Executive Dysfunction (ED) theory of autism explains some distinctive behavioral patterns of individuals with autism in terms of a breakdown of executive processes.  This view is supported by the fact that persons with autism regularly exhibit deficits in deliberate goal-directed behavior, planning, and flexible responding in changing environments.  A more detailed examination of their performance reveals, however, that some aspects of executive function remain developmentaly appropriate.  In particular, while people with autism often have difficulty with tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, their fundamental cognitive control capabilities, such as those involved in inhibiting an inappropriate but relatively automatic response, show no significant impairment on many tasks.  In this article, an existing computational model of the prefrontal cortex and its role in executive control is shown to explain this dichotomous pattern of behavior by positing abnormalities in the dopamine-based modulation of frontal systems in individuals with autism.  This model offers excellent qualitative and quantitative fits to performance on standard tests of cognitive control and cognitive flexibility in this clinical population.  By simulating the development of the prefrontal cortex, the computational model also offers a potential explanation for an observed lack of executive dysfunction early in life.

\section{Introduction}

People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often impaired
across a range of cognitive tasks, including
planning~\cite{Ozonoff:1991:AutismED,OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST},
flexibly adapting behavior~\cite{OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST,LopezBR:2005:EFAutism}, and
tasks requiring spontaneous generation of novel behaviors and
ideas~\cite{TurnerMA:1999:AutismNovelty}.  All of these tasks have
been associated with executive control processes, so the observed
impairments have led some researchers to view executive dysfunction as
a central feature of autism.  Indeed, the Executive Dysfunction (ED)
theory of autism seeks to explain many of the behavioral patterns
exhibited by these individuals in terms of a failure of executive
control over behavior~\cite{HughesC:1994:AutismED}.

A wealth of data provides strong support for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) being a
major contributing area in executive
functioning~\cite{Goldman-RakicPS:1987:PFC,StussDT:2001:StroopLesion,StussDT:2000:WCSTLesion,MillerEK:2001:PFC}.
Along with the central claim of ED theory, this suggests that the root cause
of many autistic behavioral patterns may lie in abnormalities in this
region of the brain.  This is an interesting hypothesis because, while
substantial progress has been made in many areas of autism research,
no consensus has been reached concerning the neural basis of the
disorder.  This view of ED suggests that the irregular development of
prefrontal cortex may underly some important patterns of cognitive performance
seen in autism.  

However, a more detailed examination reveals that not all forms of
executive processing are commonly
impaired~\cite{Ozonoff:1997:AutismInhibition,RussellJ:1999:AutismInhibition,LopezBR:2005:EFAutism,Adams:2009:InhibitionASD,Christ:2007:InhibitionASD}.
Indeed, a somewhat perplexing aspect of the executive profile
demonstrated by people with autism is that cognitive flexibility has
been shown to be impaired while fundamental cognitive control remains
robust and relatively unaffected.  Cognitive control describes our
ability to enact a behavior in the presence of a distracting or more
automatic competing response.  In contrast, cognitive flexibility can
be described as our ability to fluently adjust cognitive control as
contingencies change.  A classic measure of cognitive control is the
Stroop task~\cite{StoopJR:1935:Interference}, and a common measure of
cognitive flexibility is performance on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test
(WCST)~\cite{BergEA:1948:WCST}.  Persons with autism have been shown
to exhibit poor WCST performance, but they exhibit no more
interference on the Stroop task than healthy
controls~\cite{OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST}.  In fact, the distinct
pattern of reduced cognitive flexibility but relatively retained
cognitive control found in people with autism is very different than
many patterns of executive dysfunction exhibited in other disorders.
This suggests that the neural causes of executive dysfunction in
autism might be substantially different than those giving rise to
executive control problems in other disorders.  For instance, in
schizophrenia, control is impaired in tasks such as Stroop.  Some have
attributed this deficit to an inability to actively maintain the
proper contextual information in PFC, resulting in a lack of critical
top-down guidance needed to overcome more prepotent processing
pathways~\cite{CohenJD:1992:Schizophrenia,McGrathJ:1997:Schizophrenia}.
In patients with frontal damage, both control and flexibility are
impaired, in comparison to
controls~\cite{StussDT:2000:WCSTLesion,StussDT:2001:StroopLesion}.
Yet another pattern of results is seen in Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), where deficits have been observed in
inhibitory control without significant deficits in cognitive
flexibility~\cite{OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST}.  These varied
observations suggest that executive processes include multiple
components that can be selectively damaged.  Specifically, the
appearance of impairments in cognitive flexibility combined with
spared cognitive control in autism challenges the most basic
conjecture that autism involves a global dysfunction of executive
processes, perhaps due to frontal abnormalities.


A second challenge appears in the developmental trajectory of
executive deficits in autism.  In young children with autism,
executive abilities appear developmentally appropriate when compared with controls matched
for age and verbal ability~\cite{GriffithEM:1999:AutismYoungED},
calling into question the role of ED in the etiology of autism. 
Any theory intending to explain executive dysfunction in autism must
account for the relative cognitive ``strengths'' and ``weaknesses''
that have been observed, as well as for the lack of observable
deficits early in development.


One clear approach to explaining the executive profile seen in ASD
involves positing separate mechanisms for cognitive control and for
the flexible adaptation of control.  In autism, the mechanism for
control might be intact, but the mechanism responsible for the
flexible adjustment of control might be compromised.  Interestingly,
this segregation of function is captured by an existing computational
model of the prefrontal cortex and its role in executive processing:
the \emph{Cross-Task Generalization model (XT)}.  Driven by broad
neurocomputational considerations, XT casts the prefrontal cortex as
central to cognitive control, while interactions between the PFC and
the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system mediate the flexible adaptation of
control.  The XT model has previously been used to capture the
performance of both frontally damaged individuals and healthy controls
on both the Stroop task and WCST~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT}.

In this report, we demonstrate how the separation of function and mechanisms that is elucidated in the XT model can help explain the
executive processing profile exhibited by persons with autism.  Specifically, we hypothesize that the unique patterns of executive performance in people with autism can be explained by considering the detailed mechanistic implementation of control and flexibility separately, in terms of active maintenance of representations in the PFC for control, and the updating of these representations within the PFC for flexibility.  This is in contrast to the more general executive dysfunction theory, where executive control processes are not defined precisely.  To investigate our hypothesis, we demonstrate that weakening the influence of DA
on pyramidal cells in PFC in the XT model is sufficient to both
qualitatively and quantitatively capture autistic performance on both
Stroop and WCST.  This suggests that the specific executive profile demonstrated by people with autism may be mediated by PFC/DA interactions.
Importantly, XT is a learning model, in which the development of
neural representations and associated behavioral performance can be
tracked as the model matures.  Leveraging this property of XT, we show
that the late appearance of executive deficits might be explained by
the late maturation of PFC representations and PFC/DA interactions.
According to the model, early performance is driven largely by
non-frontal, more posterior, brain systems which are largely
unaffected by the posited DA-related abnormalities in autism.  As PFC
becomes more effective, differences in PFC/DA interactions are
unmasked.  



\section{Background}

\subsection{Gating the Prefrontal Cortex}

PFC has been broadly implicated both in cognitive control and cognitive
flexibility~\cite{StussDT:2000:WCSTLesion,StussDT:2001:StroopLesion}. 
Under some accounts, cognitive control depends upon the active
maintenance of abstract rule-like representations in PFC.  These
sustained PFC representations provide a top-down task-appropriate
processing bias to more posterior brain
areas~\cite{MillerEK:2001:PFC,CohenJD:1990:Stroop}.  Behaviorally, this is believed to provide an avenue to guide our behavior in a manner consistent with the maintained representation within the PFC.  Biologically, the active
maintenance of frontal control representations is supported by dense
patterns of recurrent excitation in the PFC, as well as intrinsic
maintenance
currents~\cite{Goldman-RakicPS:1987:PFC,MillerEK:1996:PFCMaint,SeamansJK:2003:PersistentActivity,SeamansJK:2004:DAinPFC}.
Analyses of these neural circuits have shown that active
maintenance and the flexible adaptation of control are at odds.  The
mechanisms that maintain PFC representations, and protect them from
distracting inputs, act as an obstacle to the rapid updating of PFC
contents in response to shifting contingencies.  In other words, the ability to focus on a goal or specific aspect of a task is at odds with the ability to switch the goal as our environment changes.  Thus, in order to achieve flexible behavior, a separate process is needed to
intelligently and rapidly update the actively maintained PFC control
representations in a task appropriate manner.  This process has been
described as an \emph{adaptive gating mechanism}.  This mechanism
learns, from experience, when PFC contents should be protected from
interference, effectively closing the ``gate'' between PFC and its
inputs, and when PFC contents should be rapidly updated, opening the
``gate'' to allow inputs to change PFC neural firing
patterns and subsequently change the focus that is guiding our behavior to some other relevant rule or goal~\cite{BraverTS:2000:Control}.  The XT model includes such an
adaptive gating mechanism, with the process of learning when to update
PFC contents mediated by the midbrain dopamine
system~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT} as described next.

\subsection{Dopamine \& Temporal Difference Learning}

The firing of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons has long been
associated with reward.  Evidence continues to accumulate for a more
nuanced interpretation of these cells, however, in which DA encodes a
measure of \emph{change in expected future reward}~\cite{MontaguePR:1996:Dopamine,SchultzW:1997:DA}.  This
interpretation is important because it links biological observations
to the machine learning literature, where a measure of change in
expected future reward is called the \emph{temporal difference (TD)
error}.  The TD error plays a central role in a class of reinforcement
learning algorithms known as \emph{temporal difference (TD)
learning}~\cite{SuttonRS:1988:TD}.  This connection has led
researchers to formalize the role of midbrain DA neurons in learning
from rewards~\cite{MontaguePR:1996:Dopamine,BartoAG:1994:BG}, equating
the firing rate of DA cells with the TD error, defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta(t) \ = \ r(t) \ + \ \gamma \ V(t+1) \ - \ V(t)
\end{eqnarray}
\ldots where $r(t)$ is a measure of the reward delivered to the
organism at time $t$, $V(t)$ and $V(t+1)$ are measures of expected
future reward (``value'') for two consecutive time steps as estimated
by an \emph{adaptive critic (AC)} neural circuit (perhaps instantiated 
largely in orbitofrontal cortex), and $\gamma$ is a \emph{discount
factor}, between zero and one, which controls the degree to which a
long wait for a reward reduces its effective value to the organism.
Note that the TD error is defined so that, if the AC predicts future
reward perfectly, the value of $\delta(t)$ will consistently be zero.  
A positive TD error indicates that the organism is receiving, or is
now expecting, more reward than it was expecting during the previous
time step.  Similarly, a negative TD error indicates that the organism
is receiving, or is now expecting, less reward than it was expecting
during the previous time step.  Using TD learning, the value of
$\delta(t)$ can be used to drive learning in the AC, improving
estimates of $V(t)$ with experience.  The same TD error can also be
used to drive learning in other adaptive neural networks which select
actions, improving the organism's selection of actions so as to lead
to larger expected rewards~\cite{BartoAG:1994:BG}.  In addition to
acting as a powerful neural learning signal, influencing synaptic
plasticity, the TD error also acts as a good cue for updating PFC
contents~\cite{BraverTS:2000:Control}.  In short, increased firing of the mid-brain cells indicate that things are going better than expected, and the control representations maintained within the PFC should be strengthened (positive TD Error).  When things are going worse than expected (negative TD Error), then it is time to release the contents being maintained within the PFC and to try something else.  In the next section we describe how this biological system is implemented within the XT framework. 

\subsection{The XT Model}


The architecture of the XT model is shown in Figure~\ref{XT}.  This
computational cognitive neuroscience model makes use of the
biologically grounded Leabra
framework~\cite{OReillyRC:2000:Computational}.  Leabra is research a grade, biologically realistic, computational cognitive neuroscience modeling framework that is actively maintained and free for public use.  The input of XT
consists of two layers of neural units that can be used to specify the
presentation of up to two stimulus objects.  It is natural to think of
the rows of each input layer as representing different stimulus
dimensions (e.g., color, shape, texture) and the columns indexing
features across each dimension (e.g., red, orange, green, blue).  The
output Response layer has essentially the same structure as an input
layer, with strong lateral inhibition among response units allowing
the network to output a single stimulus feature (e.g., red) at a
time.  
% The Response layer includes one additional unit, which codes
% for a ``no'' response.  
(The tasks to be performed by this network are described below.)

         simulated neural processing units.  Arrows represent complete
         connectivity from all of the neurons in one layer to all of
         the neurons in another.  Fast, pooled, lateral inhibition is
         implemented within each layer, but is not shown.  Note the
         recurrent excitatory connections present in the PFC layer.}
\label{XT}
\end{figure}

A collection of additional processing units called ``Hidden'' layers are used to model various posterior
cortical circuits that map from stimuli to responses.  Importantly, information processing in
these layers can be adjusted using top-down signals from
an actively maintained representation in the PFC layer.  Unlike previous
computational models, the representations that can be maintained in PFC are learned
through a ``development'' process that
involves extensive training on a variety of simple tasks.  These
developmental tasks all share a need to selectively attend to individual
dimensions of the stimuli.  For instance, the network might be
presented with a stimulus pattern representing a large red circle and
a small red square.  Through input activity at the Task layer, the
network might be asked to identify the feature that is the ``same''
across these two stimuli.  In this case, the network must focus upon
the ``color'' dimension of the stimuli and respond by activating the
``red'' unit in the Response layer.
% \footnote{If the two stimuli had no features in common, the network
% would be expected to activate the ``no'' Response layer unit.}  
On each trial, corrective feedback is provided to adjust the sensitivity of modeled neurons to their inputs, driving the 
synaptic learning processes.  In addition to this supervised learning process, correct responses from
the network result in an external reward signal ($r(t)$), that is used by the adaptive gating mechanism described below.
Over time, this developmental training process causes the network to selectively
activate the hidden layer representations of relevant stimulus
dimensions, allowing the network to effectively attend to a single
dimension at a time~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT}.

The Task input to the network is used to indicate which task is to be
performed, with one input unit coding for each task.  Tasks included
operations like \emph{naming} a feature (e.g., ``What color is this
stimulus?''), \emph{matching} two stimuli (e.g., ``Are these two
stimuli of the same shape?''), and \emph{comparison} of features
(e.g., ``What is the size of the larger of these two stimuli?'').  The
Dimension Cue layer is used to inform the network of the currently
relevant stimulus dimension.  For example, the Dimension Cue input is
used to model the Stroop task by informing the network when it should
attend to the color of the stimulus rather than its word form, or vice
versa.  Each unit in the Dimension Cue layer corresponds to a stimulus
dimension, and all of these inputs are turned off for tasks in which
the network must discover the relevant stimulus dimension on its own,
such as in WCST.  In the original XT model, each stimulus has five
dimensions, with four feature levels per dimension, and four different
tasks are used during developmental training of the model.

The flexible adjustment of cognitive control is implemented using a
DA-based adaptive gating (AG) mechanism.  The special AG unit receives
its input from the PFC layer and calculates, using learned synaptic
strengths from the PFC to the AG, to produce a $V(t)$ value --- an estimate of
the amount of reward the network should expect given the current PFC
state and past experience.  The synaptic weights on connections
leading into the AG are adjusted based on the TD error, $\delta(t)$,
using a neural implementation of the TD learning
algorithm~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT}.  Importantly, the TD error, which
encodes a DA signal, is also used to determine when PFC contents are
to be updated.  This adaptive gating process is performed in the
following manner.

When the model receives more reward than expected, $\delta(t)$ is greater
than zero.  This results in the current PFC representation being
strengthened using an intrinsic maintenance current to stabilize the
existing pattern of activity.  The actively maintained control state
can subsequently affect processing in a manner favoring actions
consistent with the contents of PFC (e.g., shift attention in the
Hidden layers to a relevant stimulus dimension).  When the model
performs worse than expected ($\delta(t) < 0$), the current PFC
representation is destabilized, allowing a new, possibly more
appropriate PFC representation, based on the inputs into the PFC
layer, to be entertained.  Over time, the network learns to maintain
PFC representations that are likely to result in reward.

The XT model is the first computational cognitive neuroscience model
to explore the development of PFC representations, and it is the first
to provide good quantitative fits to both Stroop and WCST data in a
single model, for both neurologically intact and frontally damaged
people, based on a biologically informed architecture.  Utilizing the
XT modeling framework, we have investigated if reducing the overall
ability of DA to stabilize and destabilize the representations
contained within the PFC is sufficient to explain the specific
patterns of executive dysfunction demonstrated by people with autism.

\subsection{Dopamine Abnormalities}

%TK LOOK AT MORE RECENT WORK WITH DA?
% Also, what is HVA?
The evidence for neurotransmitter abnormalities in ASD is varied, but, taken as a whole, worth further consideration.
Abnormal DA levels have been demonstrated through many measures including PET, measures of DA metabolites such as homovanillic acid (HVA), and through the use of DA modulators in clinical trials demonstrating some mitigation of problematic behavior in ASD~\cite{FernellE:1997:AutismPET,MartineauJ:1992:AutismDA,TsaiLY:1999:AutismDA}.  Recently, studies have found potential genetic differences in specific dopamine receptors as well as evidence that differences in the morphology of the basal ganglia is potentially relevant in ASD~\cite{deJongeM:2012:DopamineASDGenetics,MostofskySH:2010:BasalGangliaASDMotor}.  While the precise causal role, if any, that DA plays in autism is still an active area of investigation, this neurotransmitter does have interesting ties to numerous core deficits and related symptoms in autism spectrum disorders, including seizures~\cite{StarrMS:1996:SeizuresDA,TuchmanR:2002:EpilepsyAutism}, motor problems~\cite{RinehartNJ:2001:AutismMovement,RinehartNJ:2006:AutismGait}, repetitive behaviors~\cite{CanalesJJ:2000:Stereotypy,RalphRJ:2001:Perseveration,Ralph-WilliansRJ:2003:HyperactiveDA}, and neurogenesis~\cite{BortaA:2007:NeurogenesisDA}.  This broad range of DA-related symptoms that are often observed in ASD suggests a potentially larger role for DA in ASD than has been previously considered.


\subsection{WCST}

The WCST makes use of a deck of cards, where each card is imprinted
with a stimulus that can vary along three dimensions (e.g., color,
shape, and quantity) and across four different feature levels per
dimension (e.g., for the color dimension: red, orange, green, \&
blue).  Participants are told to sort the cards into piles, but they
are not given any instructions concerning how to do this
correctly.  Instead, only sparse performance feedback --- ``Correct''
sort or ``Incorrect'' sort --- is given upon the placement of each
card, with feedback based on a sorting criterion (i.e., one of the
stimulus dimensions) known only to the experimenter.  This process
continues until the participant discovers the hidden ``correct''
sorting strategy.  After this sorting rule (e.g., sort by color) is
learned by the participant, as demonstrated by 10 consecutive cards
sorted correctly, the sorting rule is changed without informing the
learner.  This procedure continues until either 6 correct categories
(sets of 10 correct consecutive sorts) are achieved, or all 128 cards
in the deck are exhausted.  Errors are recorded as incorrect sorts,
with \emph{perseverative errors} scored as incorrect sorts that would
be considered correct according to the previous sorting rule.  Success
at WCST requires the ability to flexibly change the stimulus dimension
of interest.  From the perspective of the XT model, this ability
involves updating the sorting rule actively maintained in PFC as
contingencies change.  

\subsection{Stroop}
The Stroop task tests cognitive control by measuring the ability to
inhibit a prepotent response.  In Stroop, the stimuli are different
words presented in various colored fonts.  Participants are asked to
either read the word or to name the color of the font in which the
text is presented.  People are faster overall at reading the word as
opposed to naming the color of the word.  Furthermore, when comparing
a neutral condition (e.g., the word ''house'' in red font)  with an
incongruent condition (e.g., the word ``green'' written in red font),
people are slower in the incongruent case for color naming, but not
for word reading.  The magnitude of this increase in response time is
known as \emph{Stroop interference}.

\citeA{CohenJD:1992:Schizophrenia} provided a seminal computational
account of human performance on the Stroop task.  Their model
incorporated separate word reading and color naming pathways through
posterior cortical areas, with the word reading pathway made more
automatic by strengthening the synaptic strengths along that pathway.
A task representation --- either ``word reading'' or ``color naming''
--- was actively maintained in a layer of simulated PFC neurons,
providing top-down activity into the pathway corresponding to the
current task.  When performing the ``color naming'' task, this
top-down activity was necessary to consistently overcome the stronger
word reading pathway, and, in the incongruent condition, response
competition between the inherently stronger pathway (word reading) and
the pathway supported by top-down PFC activity (color naming) resulted
in an increase in the time needed to activate an output response.
Response time was not elevated in the word reading incongruent
condition, however, as the weaker color naming pathway, when left
without activation support from PFC, offered little competition for
the stronger word reading pathway.

\section{Methods}
A total of 100 XT model networks were prepared using the standard XT
developmental training procedure, stopping when the network achieved a
generalization performance criterion of no more than $10\%$ error on a 
random sample of $250$ trials involving novel stimulus items,
or after a maximum of 100 training epochs~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT}, where training epoch involved
training for $2000$ trials.  Two versions of each network were then
examined:  one with normal DA modulation ($\kappa = 1.00$), and one
with reduced DA modulation ($\kappa = 0.54$).  Each resulting network
was treated as an individual experimental participant for the purposes
of data analysis. This resulted in a sample size of (n=100) for the control group and (n=100) for the group simulating performance of people with autism.   Each ``individual'' was tested on both the WCST and the Stroop task.  


\subsection{Gating Mechanism}
Based on the conceptual framework provided by the XT model, we
hypothesize that a deficit in DA functioning can account for the
impaired cognitive flexibility seen in people with autism, while
leaving cognitive control robust and relatively unaffected.  We have
tested the plausibility of this conjecture by reducing the effect of
the DA signal in the XT model.  Specifically, we scale the neural signal provided by the DA system (TD error)
by a constant factor, $\kappa$, where $\kappa = 1$ for models of
healthy individuals and $\kappa < 1$ for models of people with autism.

\begin{eqnarray}
\delta(t) \ = \kappa( \ r(t) \ + \ \gamma \ V(t+1) \ - \ V(t) )
\end{eqnarray}

The scaling of $\delta(t)$ by $\kappa$ is the \emph{only} modification
from the original XT model that we have made in these simulations,
introducing only a single free parameter.  A parameter search revealed a $\kappa$ value of $0.54$
produced the best fit to human performance, so this value was used in all of our simulations.  The paramter fitting consisted of a simple grid search, between .5 and 1.0 adjusting $\kappa$ by intervals of .1 between these values.  Below a value of $\kappa = .5$ the network failed to reach criterion during training. Between the values of .5 and 1, the networks demonstrated a monotonic increase in perseverative errors as described in the WCST section below.
% DCN - Do we need to discuss exactly which data was fit to select
% this value of kappa?
% TK - I'm on the fence here, but I believe I fit the model to the
% Stroop reaction time data and the WCST results fell out naturally
% from there.  I'd say we hold off on including the extra detail, if a
% reviewer asks for it then we have the ability to add a sentence.
This reduction in the strength of the DA signal can be seen as
decreasing the efficacy of the PFC adaptive gating mechanism,
resulting in the less efficient destabilization of PFC when errors are
unexpectedly made.

\subsection{Modeling WCST}


Modeling WCST using the XT model required use of only three of the
five possible input stimulus dimensions, which can be thought of as
representing dimensions such as color, shape, and numerocity.  The
protocol for administrating WCST to human participants was followed
without modification in these simulations.  The network was presented
with one stimulus item at a time, representing the current card to be
sorted.  The task of the network was to name the currently relevant
feature (e.g., the feature ``red'' if color is the currently relevant
sorting dimension and the current stimulus is red).  No explicit
information was provided to the network concerning the current correct
sorting dimension, leaving the network to use a more-or-less random
search strategy until the correct rule was discovered.  The only
information about the correct rule that was available to the network
took the form of sparse feedback --- ``reward'' or ``no reward'' ---
with reward ($r(t) = 1$) only arriving upon each correct sort.  The XT
model is able to leverage this feedback through its DA based AG
mechanism, coupled with the active maintenance and top-down modulatory
properties of the PFC layer, in order to successfully perform this
task.  The AG mechanism strengthens the PFC’s intrinsic maintenance
currents when the network is performing well, allowing the PFC to
actively maintain currently relevant information (e.g., pay attention
to the color dimension), and this sustained pattern of neural firing
modulates processing pathways elsewhere in the model so as to amplify
relevant information about the current stimulus.  In a sense, the
actively maintained patterns of PFC neural firing form a \emph{working
memory} trace of the current sorting rule.  When the correct rule is
changed (i.e., after 10 consecutive correct sorts), this actively
maintained rule representation becomes invalid.  If the network
continues to actively maintain the invalid rule, allowing it to
influence subsequent processing, perseverative errors will result.
The AG mechanism prevents this by sending a DA based updating signal 
($\delta(t) < 0$) to the PFC when reward is expected but not
delivered.  This updating signal destabilizes the current PFC
contents, allowing a new rule representation to be sampled, based on
the current inputs to the PFC.

\subsection{Modeling Stroop}


In order to simulate the relative prepotency of a stimulus dimension
in the XT model, we manipulated the frequency with which one dimension
was experienced as relevant during the initial developmental training
received by the network.  This target dimension, representing font
color, was relevant over the course of developmental training only
25\% as often as the other stimulus dimensions, such as word reading.  A competition between
the color naming and word reading pathways was simulated by
co-activating features in this weaker dimension, corresponding to the
color naming pathway, and a stronger dimension, representing the word
reading pathway.  In the XT model, the PFC layer provides the crucial
top-down activation-based support, consistent with the model of
\citeA{CohenJD:1992:Schizophrenia}, to resolve the competition in a
manner appropriate for the current task.  The time needed for output
firing rate levels to stabilize (i.e., the \emph{settling time}) in
the face of this competition was used as an analog to human reaction
time.  Network settling time, measured as a number of simulated ``time
steps'', was scaled to milliseconds using a multiplicative scaling
parameter selected so as to fit mean human data \emph{only in the
congruent word reading condition}.  This scaling factor was then used,
without modification, to translate model settling times in all
conditions into millisecond measures that could be directly compared
to human reaction times.

\section{Results}


\subsection{Initial WCST Results}

Our simulations of both healthy individuals (i.e., models with normal
DA modulation) and persons with autism (i.e., models with reduced DA
modulation) displayed a reliable difference between these groups, with
the ASD models showing a reduction of cognitive flexibility as
measured by an increase in perseverative errors.  (See
Table~\ref{WCST-stats} for mean error results.)  In particular, the
number of perseverative errors was significantly higher in networks
with reduced DA modulation, mirroring the behavior of people with ASD
on this task, as reported in the
literature~\cite{PriorM:1990:AutismWCST,BennettoL:1996:AutismPlanning,OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST,MinshewNJ:2002:AutismWCST}.
Indeed, without performing any additional model fitting, the mean
number of perseverative errors produced by the models provides a
reasonable match to the human data of
\citeA{MinshewNJ:2002:AutismWCST}, as shown in Figure~\ref{WCST-fit}.

\subsection{Initial Stroop Results}

Model performance on the Stroop task provided good quantitative and
qualitative fits to human performance.  (See
Figure~\ref{Stroop-results} for a comparison of reaction time
performance for the healthy networks, the networks simulating people
with autism, and healthy human data
from~\citeA{DunbarK:1984:StroopData}.)  The model with normal DA
function displayed the classic Stroop reaction time results.  The
prepotent word reading dimension showed uniform reaction times across
both congruent and conflict conditions, while the weaker color naming
dimension exhibited a slowing in reaction times when the stimuli were
incongruent, successfully demonstrating the Stroop effect.
Importantly, the performance of the autistic models was virtually
identical to the that of the healthy models, with no significant
increase in the overall Stroop interference ($F(1, 198) = 0.62$; $p >
0.43$).  This is consistent with previously reported findings that
people with autism show no reliable increase in Stroop interference,
as compared with
controls~\cite{RussellJ:1999:AutismInhibition,OzonoffS:1999:AutismStroopWCST,Adams:2009:InhibitionASD,Christ:2007:InhibitionASD}.

\section{Developmental Results}

\subsection{Developmental Simulations}

Our initial simulations involved the introduction of a DA deficit only
after the model had undergone a standard process of simulated
development.  Thus, these initial simulations ignored the possibility
that an early manifestation of a DA deficit might hinder the proper
learning of PFC representations, introducing an impairment in
cognitive control in the model that is not observed in people with
autism.  In order to address this shortcoming, a second set of
simulations was conducted in which DA modulation was reduced in the
autistic models from the very beginning of developmental training.  In
order to examine the developmental time course of cognitive control
and cognitive flexibility in these models, Stroop and WCST performance
were analyzed over the entire developmental period of the model (100
training epochs).  Two groups of 10 networks, with each network
treated as an individual for the purpose of analysis, were used.  The
autistic model group developed with reduced DA modulation ($\kappa =
0.54$), while the control model group underwent development training
in the same manner as the original XT model ($\kappa = 1.00$). 

At the end of developmental training, these groups of networks
exhibited exactly the same pattern of results as seen in the initial
simulations.  In particular, no deficit appeared in the Stroop data,
and perseverative errors remained elevated, as compared to controls,
in WCST.  Furthermore, the developmental time course data provided
some insight into why executive deficits might appear late in autism,
as described in the literature~\cite{GriffithEM:1999:AutismYoungED}.
These developmental results are discussed next.

\subsection{Developed PFC Representations}

Figure~\ref{PFC-epoch005} and Figure~\ref{PFC-epoch100} plot the
synaptic strengths from the PFC layer to the Response layer in the XT
model.  The left panel of each figure shows synaptic weights for a
representative healthy control network, and the right panel of each
figure shows the corresponding data for a representative autistic
network.  Each large rectangle in a panel corresponds to a modeled PFC
unit, and each encapsulated small box corresponds to a modeled
Response unit, with the strength of the connection from the given PFC
unit to the given Response unit being reflected in the brightness of
the box (i.e., lighter means stronger).  Note that each row of small
boxes designates connections to Response layer units representing
features in the same stimulus dimension.  Specifically, the presence of bright horizontal bands in these plots indicate that individual PFC units have learned, over the course of development, to modulate all features associated with a single stimulus dimension and none of the features associated with other dimensions.  Thus, these plots can be
used to examine the degree to which the PFC layer developed synaptic
weights that encoded individual stimulus dimensions in the firing
rates of individual PFC units as demonstrated in previous work~\cite{RougierNP:2005:XT}.  In Figure~\ref{PFC-epoch005}, which
was generated early in the course of developmental training, both the
autistic network and the control network lack strong dimensional
weights.  However, in Figure~\ref{PFC-epoch100}, which was generated
at the end of developmental training, both networks have developed
strong dimensional representations in PFC, as evidenced by the
extremely salient horizontal bands of ``strong'' synaptic
weights.  Thus, appropriate PFC representations were acquired only
slowly over the course of developmental training, and the DA
manipulation used to model autism did not hinder the formation of
these representations.  Please note the following analysis is intended to provide the user with a intuition about the pattern and strength of connectivity that the network learned after development.  However, this should be viewed as a qualitative analysis, since what constitutes ``strong'' vs. ``weak'' is difficult to quantify precisely.

\label{PFC-epoch100}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Executive Dysfunction Development}

Introducing damage to the DA based adaptive gating mechanism from the
beginning of development still allows the XT model to capture autistic
performance on tasks requiring cognitive flexibility and control.
Stroop interference over the course of developmental training,
averaged over the networks, is shown in Figure~\ref{Devel-Stroop}.
Note the lack of an effect of the DA manipulation across the
developmental period.  Statistically, Stroop interference was
significantly greater for the autistic networks during only 1 epoch
out of the 100 experienced during development ($p < 0.003$),
demonstrating robust cognitive control throughout the entirety of
development.  In contrast, Figure~\ref{Devel-WCST} plots WCST
perseverative errors over the course of developmental training,
averaged over the networks.  This graph clearly shows a significant
increase in the number of perseverative errors made by the autistic
networks over time, with a significant difference between the autistic
networks and the control networks appearing as early as epoch 12.
During the first 50 epochs there was a significant difference ($p <
0.05$ on a one-tailed t-test) between the groups of networks during
only $28\%$ of the epochs.  However, later in developmental training,
during epochs 51--100, there were significantly more perseverative
errors in the autistic networks during $88\%$ of the epochs.  In other
words, neither the healthy models nor the models of autism showed a
distinct advantage during the earliest stages of development, despite
the presence of a reduction in DA modulation in one group, but not the
other.  The relative lack of executive deficits early in the
development of these models could be due to the fact that both groups
of networks lacked strong PFC representations early in training.
Without strongly dimensional PFC representations, the models were
forced to rely more heavily on synaptic plasticity in the Hidden
layers (posterior cortical areas) to perform the tasks.  Since
weakening the DA based adaptive gating mechanism had no direct effect
on these non-frontal areas of the model, neither group of networks
showed any advantage over the other during this early stage.  Thus,
our model predicts that the lack of executive dysfunction observed in
young children with autism results from the protracted development
period required by the PFC in both normally developing children and
children with autism.

\section{Discussion}

These results demonstrate that dopamine may play a broader role in the
development of ASD than has been previously imagined, providing a
novel explanation of how patterns of ED may emerge in autism via
disturbed PFC/DA interactions.  Given the XT account of the role of
PFC in executive control, we have shown that a single manipulation ---
reducing the efficacy of the DA signal --- is sufficient to capture
the pattern of performance exhibited by people with autism on basic
tests of cognitive flexibility (WCST) and cognitive control (Stroop).
In WCST, our models of autistic performance commit significantly more
errors and, importantly, more perseverative errors when compared to
simulated performance of normally functioning controls.  This pattern
of errors indicates that by weakening the effect of dopamine on gating of contents within the PFC, the ability of the
model to flexibly adapt its behavior as task contingencies change is
greatly reduced.  In the simulations of Stroop performance, on the
other hand, there is no significant change in performance when
comparing the models with a reduced DA signal to those with no DA
deficit.  The Stroop model results indicate that reducing DA
modulation of cells in PFC does not appear to affect the ability of
PFC to actively maintain representations which can be used to
influence subsequent processing in more posterior pathways.  However,
the WCST results point to a strong effect on the adaptive gating
mechanism of PFC, resulting in a reduced ability to switch contexts in
an appropriate manner.  

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that weakening the DA based adaptive
gating mechanism in the XT model over the entire course of PFC
development continues to reflect both the strengths and weaknesses of
autistic performance, while also providing some insight into the late
appearance of cognitive flexibility deficits in autism.  Specifically,
the absence of strong PFC representations early in development masks
the problematic PFC/DA interactions.  As the model continues to
develop, however, and the PFC representations strengthen, the weakened
DA based adaptive gating mechanism manifests itself behaviorally as
impaired cognitive flexibility.  In this way, this model offers a
candidate explanation for the late development of ED in
autism~\cite{GriffithEM:1999:AutismYoungED}.


Autism is an extremely  heterogeneous disorder.  Behavior is often diverse and varied, even within a single study.  While data concerning the neural basis of these cognitive differences is rapidly accumulating, much mystery remains concerning the relationship between biology and behavior in autism.  Indeed, an examination of the current literature quickly reveals a multitude of studies implicating nearly any brain region as a source of behavioral changes in ASD.  The combination of diverse behavior and an abundance of neurological differences results in a stout challenge for the progression of any specific theory in this field.  This paper demonstrates how the tools of computational cognitive neuroscience may provide some assistance in this endeavor by rigorously characterizing the behavioral effects of differences in brain function.  Computational modeling methods of this kind have been applied to autism spectrum disorders by only a few researchers, and these past efforts have often been relatively cursory, lacking direct comparisons to empirical data~\cite{CohenIL:1994:AutismLearning,McClellandJL:2000:Autism,OLoughlinC:2000:Coherence,GustafssonL:1997:AutismMaps,Grossberg:2006:neuralASD,Triesch:2006:GazeASD}.   By their very nature, computational cognitive neuroscience models add a certain amount of precision and rigor to
scientific inquiry compared with purely verbal accounts.  Underlying
assumptions are necessarily quantified and unmasked, affording more
precise and testable hypothesis.  Constraints on these assumptions
need to be made to maximize the utility of such models in autism
research.  Specifically, such models need to be constrained by both
bottom-up (neurobiological mechanisms) and top-down (observed
behavior) considerations.  When used within these constraints, models of this kind provide a kind of ``conceptual bridge'' linking various levels of data and theoretical perspectives under a unifying framework.  

Given the ample choices of brain areas to investigate, many with
intriguing correlations to behavior in autism, why champion a closer
look at the role of DA in autism?  In truth, at this point, there is
no ``smoking gun'' marking DA as the true underlying cause of any
particular behavioral deficit observed in autism.  Indeed, there is evidence for numerous neurochemical differences in people with ASD~\cite{FatemiSH:2011:ASDNeuroChem}.  However, DA does
provide a unique opportunity to provide a bridge linking seemingly
disparate and complex behavior demonstrated by people with ASD.
Neurally, dopamine affects nearly all of the brain areas associated
with autistic behavior, including the cerebellum, amygdala, PFC,
parietal lobes, and the hippocampus~\cite{BarikS:1996:CerebellumDA,JacksonME:2001:AmygdalaDA,TessitoreA:2002:AmygdalaDA,MillerEK:2001:PFC,MehtaMA:2000:ParietalDA,LiS:2003:HippocampusDA}.  Increased seizure rates, motor abnormalities, stereotyped and
repetitive behaviors, executive dysfunction, abnormal gaits, problems
learning to follow eye gaze, and attentional abnormalities are all key
components of behavior in autism, and all are linked tightly to the
midbrain dopamine system~\cite{RinehartNJ:2006:AutismGait,TuchmanR:2002:EpilepsyAutism,HillE:2004:AutismED,Ozonoff:1991:AutismED,StarrMS:1996:SeizuresDA,RalphRJ:2001:Perseveration,Ralph-WilliansRJ:2003:HyperactiveDA,GraybielAM:2000:Stereotypy,MatsumotoN:1999:StriatumDA}.
This broad range of associations is at least suggestive that the
dopaminergic system may play a prominent role in the etiology of
autism.  

Whether ED is better viewed as a primary cause of ASD or a reflection of other cognitive and biological differences is still an open and interesting question.  However, there does appear to be some consensus to viewing behavioral flexibility as suspect. Juxtaposed against this general impairment is a myriad of data suggesting that sustained attention to parts of objects or situations often appears unimpaired when compared with matched controls. It is not our intention to suggest that all behavior in people with autism can be explained by the theory of executive dysfunction we describe in this report.  Rather, we are attempting to provide a biologically inspired account that has the potential to explain a generally perplexing pattern of behavior demonstrated by many people with autism across a variety of tasks.    

We have argued that perturbed DA/PFC interactions may lead to
inflexibility in the updating of the contents of the PFC in people
with autism.  It is the goal of future research to demonstrate that
this same mechanism may be capable of linking together a diverse
range of abnormal patterns of behavior observed in people with
autism.  The modeling results reported here help to demonstrate the
utility of formal computational models for investigating the
relationship between brain and behavior in people with ASD.  Using
simulations, constrained and informed by both biology and observed
behavior, precise and testable predictions of underlying mechanisms
can be made, providing a theoretical bridge between psychological and
anatomical theories of autism.
