Both the inflexible updating (autism condition) and the addition of irrelevant information in PFC manipulations (working memory load condition) result in a restricted subset of components gaining control over behavior, demonstrating overselective behavior.}}{95}

However, the ASD group did not show a prototype effect, this is argued to support the authors conjecture that people with ASD do not form or utilize prototype representations in categorization tasks. (Please note: Only the ``Prototype'' condition is relevant to the discussion. The results for ``Familiar'' refer to a comparison in the original study investigating if there was a preference for previously experienced or novel animals.)}}{102}

However, the model of autistic performance chose the prototype on average only 52.91\% of the time over the non-prototype stimuli. Statistical analysis reveal that the control network chose the prototype at a rate significantly greater than chance ($p < .0001$) while the ASD network was not statistically distinguishable from chance ($p > .30$).}}{104}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {23}{\ignorespaces Cartoon of the lexical ambiguity model and task (the number of inputs and outputs to the network is significantly larger than what is displayed). The task of the model is to correctly respond to any input word presented within the ``INPUT'' layer of the network. This is accomplished by activating the unit representing the appropriate meaning at the ``OUTPUT'' layer of the network. There are two types of input word units, ambiguous homograph units and context units. The context units are used to disambiguate the meaning of a specific homograph unit. Words are presented to the network one at a time and it is the networks job to learn, through experience, to respond with the correct meaning via the ``OUTPUT'' layer of the network. For instance, in this figure the ambiguous homograph input unit represents the word ``Bank'' and the frequent and infrequent context input units represent ``Money'' and ``River'' respectively. When the infrequent context unit ``River'' is presented first to the network followed by the homograph unit for ``Bank'', the network was expected to learn to use the context unit's meaning to correctly respond ``Land by River''. This response occurs during the final trial when the network is probed for the correct meaning of the ambiguous homograph unit after the initial mini-clause has been presented.}}{108}
